# README

This is my version of Instagram, built on Rails. The front-end driver is ERB, the back-end database is PostgreSQL and the testing framework is RSpec

Features still to be implemented:

* Adjust likes so that a user can only do one like per photo

* Style properly using Bootstrap framework

* Update README with deployment instructions
